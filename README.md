Washington State Housing Analysis: Predicting Homeownership Using Support Vector Models

This project delves into the analysis of US Census data from Washington State to predict whether a dwelling is owned by its occupants or rented. By examining various demographic and housing-related variables such as age, income, education level, housing costs, and household size, we aim to uncover the key factors influencing homeownership.

Objectives:
Predict Homeownership: Utilize Support Vector Machine (SVM) models with linear, radial, and polynomial kernels to classify whether a home is owned or rented based on the given data.
Parameter Tuning: Optimize SVM parameters to achieve the best predictive performance.
Explore Variable Relationships: Investigate the relationships between different variables to identify the most significant predictors of homeownership.
Visualize Decision Boundaries: Create graphs to illustrate how different SVM models classify the data, highlighting decision boundaries.
Why This Matters:
For Potential Homeowners: Understand the factors that contribute to successful homeownership, aiding in better planning and decision-making.
For Policy Makers: Develop informed housing policies and programs to enhance homeownership accessibility for diverse groups.
Key Components:
Data Exploration: Detailed study of the demographic and housing data collected via the US Census.
Model Implementation: Application of SVM models (linear, radial, polynomial) to predict homeownership status.
Insights and Recommendations: Derived from the analysis to provide actionable insights for individuals and policymakers.
By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and thorough data exploration, this project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics influencing homeownership in Washington State.
